Project 2_Basic algorithms Problem 6_explanation

To start with, we create two variables, min and max, that is equal to the length of the ints list, and to dynamically track the numbers when traversing
During iteration, if a number is greater than the original max, then update max with that value.
If a number is smaller than the original min, then update min with that value
In this case, the complexity would be O(n), in a single traverse.


Efficiency:
The time efficiency is O(n), since we have to iterate through the whole list in the worst case.
The space efficiency is O(1), since we are updating the values of two variables during each iteration, the spaces for holding these two variables are independent of the inputs.
