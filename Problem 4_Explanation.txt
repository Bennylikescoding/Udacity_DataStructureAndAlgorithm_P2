Project 2_Basic algorithms Problem 4_explanation

We will iterate through the list and keep track of the number of 0, 1, or 2
Then we just create a new list using the above information


Efficiency:
The time efficiency is O(n), since we are iterating all input variables.
The space efficiency is O(n), since we are creating a new list to return a re-arranged list.
